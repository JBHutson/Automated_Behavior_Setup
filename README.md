Automated Behavioral Setup

This project is made in conjunction with the McElliot Lab, specifically under the guidence of Karl T. Schmidt. 

The purpose of this project is to create a more economically viable option for automated behavioral testing involving the collection of 
licks via lick-o-meter.

Capacitive Sensor: This sub-folder contains the C++ code that should be used with an Arduino to create the circuits with drinking bottles that will allow for the detection of licks from the mouse

Python Code: this sub-folder contains the python code that will take the data from the arduino and both present a live graph as well as save the data in a .csv folder for future reference
