Automated Behavioral Setup

This project is made in conjunction with the McElliot Lab, specifically under the guidence of Karl T. Schmidt. 

The purpose of this project is to create a more economically viable option for automated behavioral testing involving the collection of 
licks via lick-o-meter.

Capacitive Sensor: This sub-folder contains the C++ code that should be used with an Arduino to create the circuits with drinking bottles that will allow for the detection of licks from the mouse

Main Code: This sub-folder contains the code to run the server and client between the Raspberry Pi and the Computer, the code to for the manipulation of the data sent to the computer, the GUI code (unfinished) and the shell drivers for the computer and Pi.
